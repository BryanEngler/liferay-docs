# Activating Liferay DXP

[TOC levels=1-4]

There are 2 ways to activate your Liferay DXP instance: 

-   With an XML activation key that you request and receive from Liferay 
    Support. 

-   Online activation through Liferay Connected Services (LCS). Liferay DXP 7.0 
    introduced LCS as a way to activate Liferay DXP instances. LCS can also 
    install fix packs, monitor each instance's performance, and help 
    administrators automatically manage Liferay DXP subscriptions. See the 
    [LCS documentation](/docs/7-0/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/managing-liferay-with-liferay-connected-services) 
    for instructions on activating your instances with LCS. 

| **Note:** You must use LCS for activation of containerized instances, cloud
| deployments, and instances that use Liferay Analytics Cloud and/or elastic
| subscriptions. Otherwise, you don't have to use LCS for activation. You can
| instead request an XML activation key from Liferay Support.
