# LCS Preconfiguration

[TOC levels=1-4]

| **Note:** The following LCS features have been deprecated and removed in
| March 2020: Page Analytics, Fix Pack Management, and Portal Properties. Please
| read the
| [LCS Feature Deprecation Update](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037317691-Liferay-Connected-Services-Feature-Deprecation-Update-March-2020)
| to learn more about how you can prepare for these upcoming changes.

To take full advantage of Liferay Connected Services (LCS), you must first
register your server with LCS. Before doing so, however, there are a few things
you must take care of. The sections in this guide walk you through these steps:

1. [Downloading the LCS Client App](/docs/6-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/lcs-preconfiguration#downloading-the-lcs-client-app)
2. [Preconfiguring LCS to Connect Through a Proxy](/docs/6-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/lcs-preconfiguration#preconfiguring-the-lcs-client-to-connect-through-a-proxy)
3. [Ensuring Access to LCS](/docs/6-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/lcs-preconfiguration#ensuring-access-to-lcs)
4. [NTP Server Synchronization](/docs/6-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/lcs-preconfiguration#ntp-server-synchronization)
5. [Configuring the Patching Tool](/docs/6-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/lcs-preconfiguration#configuring-the-patching-tool)
6. [Installing the LCS Client App](/docs/6-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/lcs-preconfiguration#installing-the-lcs-client-app)

Also,
[the last section](/docs/6-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/lcs-preconfiguration#upgrading-the-lcs-client-app)
in this guide shows you how to upgrade the LCS client app once your server is
connected to LCS. We highly recommend that you upgrade the app whenever Liferay
releases a new version of it.

First, you'll download the LCS client app.

## Downloading the LCS Client App

To connect to LCS, you must first purchase and download the latest version of
the LCS client app for Liferay Portal 6.2 EE. You can do this via Liferay
Marketplace.

| **Note:** Even though Liferay Marketplace and this guide use the term
| *purchase*, the LCS client app is free of charge. The purchase process for a
| free app in Liferay Marketplace adds the app to your Liferay project, much like
| downloading a free app in a mobile app store adds the app to your account.

Use these steps to purchase and download the app (if you've already purchased
the app, you can skip to step 3 to download it):

1.  Navigate to
    [the LCS client app in Liferay Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/71774947).
    Sign in to Marketplace, then click the the LCS client app's *Free* button.

    ![Figure 4.1: Click the app's *Free* button to begin the purchase process.](../../images/lcs-client-app-marketplace.png)

2.  Select the project you want to associate the app with, accept the license
    agreement, and then click the *Purchase* button. Marketplace then displays
    your receipt.

    ![Figure 4.2: Liferay Marketplace displays your receipt for the LCS client app.](../../images/lcs-client-app-receipt.png)

3.  On the receipt, click *See Purchased*. This takes you to the page where you
    can download the LCS client app. To download the app, click the *App* button
    next to the version of the app you want to download.

    | **Note:** If you need to download the LCS client app later, such as when
    | [upgrading it](/docs/6-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/lcs-preconfiguration#upgrading-the-lcs-client-app),
    | select *Purchased Apps* from the User menu at the top-right of Liferay
    | Marketplace. On the Purchased Apps screen, select the project you associated
    | with the LCS client app and then select the app. This takes you to the same
    | downloads page shown in the screenshot.

    ![Figure 4.3: Click the *App* button next to the version of the app you want to download.](../../images/lcs-client-download-page.png)

Great! You've successfully downloaded the LCS client app. Before installing it,
however, there are a few additional preconfiguration steps you should complete.
The following sections of this guide walk you through these, and then show you
how to install the app.

| **Note:** If your server connects to the Internet through a proxy, you must
| configure either your server or the LCS client app **before** deploying the app.
| The following section contains instructions on this. If your server doesn't
| connect through a proxy, you can skip this section.

## Preconfiguring LCS to Connect Through a Proxy

If your server connects to the Internet through a proxy, you must set some
properties in either your server or the LCS client app **before** deploying the
app. There are therefore two ways to set these properties, depending on whether
you set them in your server or the LCS client app:

1.  As JVM app server arguments. Set these properties to the appropriate values
    for your proxy:

        -Dhttp.proxyHost=
        -Dhttp.proxyPort=
        -Dhttp.proxyUser=
        -Dhttp.proxyPassword=
        -Dhttps.proxyHost=
        -Dhttps.proxyPort=

    Note that the user, password, and https properties are only needed if your
    proxy requires authentication.

    | **Note:** If you use JVM app server arguments as instructed in this step,
    | then you don't need to preconfigure the LCS client app to connect through
    | the same proxy.

2.  To set the properties inside the LCS client app's WAR file, you must first
    extract it from the app's LPKG file (the app downloads from Liferay
    Marketplace as an LPKG file). Expand the LPKG file, then locate and expand
    the client's WAR file: `lcs-portlet-[version].war`.

    You must set the properties in the WAR's `portlet-ext.properties` file.
    Follow these steps to do so:

    a. In the LCS client's WAR file, create the file
        `WEB-INF/classes/portlet-ext.properties` (or open this file if it
        already exists).

    b. Add the following properties at the end of `portlet-ext.properties` and
       set them to the appropriate values for your proxy:

            proxy.host.name=
            proxy.host.port=

      If your proxy requires authentication, you should also add the following
      properties and set them to the appropriate values for your proxy:

            proxy.host.login=
            proxy.host.password=

      If your proxy requires NTLM authentication, you must also add the
      following properties:

            proxy.auth.type=ntlm
            proxy.domain=
            proxy.workstation=

      Be sure to set `proxy.domain` and `proxy.workstation` to the appropriate
      values for your proxy. Note that you can leave `proxy.workstation` blank
      if you don't need it.

    c. Repackage the LCS client WAR with the modified `portlet-ext.properties`
       file, then repackage the LPKG file with the LCS client WAR. Make sure the
       repackaged LPKG file has the same name as the original LPKG file
       downloaded from Liferay Marketplace.

Next, you'll learn how to ensure that the LCS client can access LCS.

## Ensuring Access to LCS

For the LCS client app to work, it must be able to access the following DNS
names. If your server is behind a proxy and/or a firewall, then you must open
access to these:

- `lcs.liferay.com`
- `lcs-gateway.liferay.com`

As an added security measure, you can also restrict traffic to HTTPS.

The next section discusses NTP server synchronization.

## NTP Server Synchronization

For LCS to work properly, the application server running Liferay Portal should
be synchronized with a time server. If it's not, you may get log errors similar
to these:

    ERROR [pool-6-thread-3][HandshakeTask:68] java.lang.RuntimeException: Handshake expired.
    Check that the server is synchronized with an NTP server.

    WARN [liferay/hot_deploy-1][LCSHotDeployMessageListener:186] LCS portlet is not connected
    java.lang.RuntimeException: com.liferay.jsonwebserviceclient.JSONWebServiceInvocationException:
    com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParseException: Unrecognized token 'oauth_problem': was expecting
    ('true', 'false' or 'null')_ at [Source: oauth_problem=timestamp_refused&oauth_acceptable_timestamps=1477311475-1477312075;
    line: 1, column: 14] [Sanitized]

For information on how to synchronize your application server with a time
server, see your application server's documentation.

Next, you'll learn how to configure Liferay Portal's patching tool.

## Configuring the Patching Tool

LCS uses Liferay Portal's patching tool to apply updates. In Liferay Portal 6.2
EE bundles, the patching tool is pre-installed. If you're not running a bundle,
you must
[download](https://help.liferay.com/hc)
and
[install](/docs/6-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/patching-liferay#installing-the-patching-tool)
the patching tool separately.

Once installed, there are a few steps you must complete before LCS can use the
patching tool. Note that the commands below apply to Linux, Unix, and Mac. If
you're running Windows, drop the `.sh` from each command that has it.

1.  Navigate to the `patching-tool` directory on the command line. It's
    typically located in the
    [Liferay Home](/docs/6-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/liferay-home)
    folder. Liferay Home is usually the parent folder of the application
    server's folder.

2.  To let the patching tool discover your Liferay Portal installation, run this
    command:

        patching-tool.sh auto-discovery

3.  To configure the patching tool, run this command:

        patching-tool.sh setup

4.  On server startup, the patching tool agent installs the patches downloaded
    by LCS. For the agent to start with your server, you must set the
    `javaagent` property in the JVM options to point to your patching tool
    installation's `patching-tool-agent.jar`. Be sure to specify the correct
    path to this file:

        -javaagent:../../patching-tool/lib/patching-tool-agent.jar

5.  If your patching tool is installed in a location other than the Liferay Home
    folder, you must also specify the `patching-tool` folder's path as an app
    server JVM argument. Do this with the `patching.tool.home` property:

        -Dpatching.tool.home=/opt/liferay-portal-6.2-ee-sp14/patching-tool/

There are also a few other things to consider when using the agent. Due to class
loading issues, the agent starts in a separate JVM. You can specify options for
it by using the `patching.tool.agent.jvm.opts` property.

        -Dpatching.tool.agent.jvm.opts="-Xmx1024m -Xms512m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"

You may also experience issues on Windows if the user starting the app server
doesn’t have administrator privileges. Here are some examples of the errors you
may see:

    java.nio.file.FileSystemException: ..\webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\lib\util-java.jar: Not a file!
    java.io.FileNotFoundException: java.io.IOException: Access refused

To solve this, set the `java.io.tmpdir` system property as follows in the
`patching.tool.agent.jvm.opts` property:

    -Dpatching.tool.agent.jvm.opts="-Xmx1024m -Xms512m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Djava.io.tmpdir=%TMP%"

The agent also has some flags you can set to control how it behaves:

- `debug`: Provides verbose output in the console.
- `nohalt`: Starts the portal even if the agent encounters an issue.

You can specify these as follows:

    -Dpatching.tool.agent.properties=debug,nohalt

## Installing the LCS Client App

Once you've addressed the above preconfiguration steps, you're ready to install
the LCS client app. Follow these steps to install the app:

1. Shut down your Liferay Portal instance if it's running.

2. Place the LCS client app in the `[Liferay_Home]/deploy` folder (create this
   `deploy` folder if it doesn't exist). Note that
   [the Liferay Home folder](/docs/6-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/liferay-home)
   is usually the parent folder of the application server's folder.

Great! Now you're all set to connect your Liferay Portal instance with LCS. For
instructions on this,
[click here](/docs/6-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/connecting-to-lcs)
to proceed to the next article.

The next section shows you how to upgrade the LCS client app. We highly
recommend that you do this whenever Liferay releases a new version of the app.

## Upgrading the LCS Client App

Your server should always be running the latest version of the LCS client app.
There are two ways to upgrade the app, depending on the exact LCS
preconfiguration steps you followed:

1.  Via Liferay Marketplace *inside* your running Liferay Portal instance. Use
    this method if you don't need to configure the LCS client app (e.g., to
    connect through a proxy) before it deploys.

    | **Note:** If you choose this method and have a clustered environment, you
    | must perform the upgrade separately on each node in your cluster. Therefore,
    | you may prefer to upgrade manually as detailed in step 2 to ensure that all
    | your nodes are running the exact same version of the LCS client app.

    To perform the upgrade, first navigate to *Admin* &rarr; *Control Panel*
    &rarr; *Apps* &rarr; *Purchased*. Apps needing an update are listed first.
    Click *Update* next to the LCS client app. Note that you may need to restart
    your server for the upgrade to complete.

2.  Manually, after downloading the LCS client app's LPKG file to your machine.
    Use this method if you need to preconfigure the LCS client app to connect
    through a proxy.

    | **Note:** If you used JVM app server arguments to configure your server to
    | connect through a proxy, then you don't need to preconfigure the LCS client
    | app to connect through the same proxy.

    To update the LCS client app manually, follow the previous sections in this
    guide for downloading and preconfiguring the app. Then deploy it to
    `[Liferay Home]/deploy` as you would any other app.

Contact Liferay Support if you need additional assistance with the upgrade
process.
